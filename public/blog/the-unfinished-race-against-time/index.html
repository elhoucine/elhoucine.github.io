<p>We often get busy doing what we do in our lives without taking the time to think clearly about the meaning and the impact of what we are doing. I think one should at least figure out what really matters to him and figure out how to live according to that. I know that life is hard but living a unfinished race against time is even harder.</p>

<h2 id="does-it-have-meaning-for-me:f0ce86dd8a375d181d9b42eb48ee774b">Does it have meaning <strong>for me</strong> ?</h2>

<p>This is a good question to answer, because what we do determines who we are, and who we will be.</p>

<p><code>Is what I am doing worth telling to my children ?</code></p>

<p>A normal, and a calculated-for-safety life is boring to tell, only the <strong>risky</strong>, <strong>challenging</strong>, unusual life is worth telling, and interesting, and capturing.</p>

<p>A <strong>risky</strong>, <strong>challenging</strong>, and unusual life is like a movie, where you are the protagonist, you have a goal in mind, there is plenty of obstacles, you may suffer, you may give up for some time, but you fight again until you achieve what&rsquo;s yours.</p>

<h2 id="caring-about-the-world:f0ce86dd8a375d181d9b42eb48ee774b">Caring about the world.</h2>

<p>Caring about the world is something meaningful, because <strong>we are not living alone</strong>, and our lives depends on each other, and you are not only a citizen of your country, you are a citizen of the world.</p>

<p>The world needs us more than ever, it needs us to follow our dreams, to live purely, to be human, to connect and to care.</p>

<h2 id="doing-art:f0ce86dd8a375d181d9b42eb48ee774b">Doing ART!</h2>

<pre><code>I want them to discover that they are artists;
everyone is an artist, a creator, and refiner of sensibility without knowing it.
--Yves Klein
</code></pre>

<p>Art is a form of freedom, because to do art is to listen to our inner voice, and imagination, it is about doing one&rsquo;s original version. So rather that following instructions we create them. Doing an original/quality work, or making someone&rsquo;s day is also an form of ART.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-with-others:f0ce86dd8a375d181d9b42eb48ee774b">Connecting with others.</h2>

<pre><code>We are like islands in the sea, separate on the surface but connected in the deep.
― William James
</code></pre>

<p>I think this may be the most meaningful thing on earth, connecting with other people, discovering new cultures&hellip; Travel is a way of doing that, and that&rsquo;s what I like most about traveling.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-with-self:f0ce86dd8a375d181d9b42eb48ee774b">Connecting with self.</h2>

<pre><code>The most beautiful things can only be created by the most free minds!
― Mehmet Murat ildan
</code></pre>

<p>Imagine a world where the sky is upon our heads, where space is filled with few vital but many trivial things, we will barely breath, and we will barely live.</p>

<p>Freeing our mind, eliminating the external noise, and making space for what matters, is the core to keep our mind in good state and our life under control.</p>
