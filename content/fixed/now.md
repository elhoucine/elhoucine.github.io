My progress report, inspired by [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/11/your-progress-report.html).

## the difficult questions that remain unanswered

## the long-term goals where you donâ€™t feel like progress is being made

## risky, generous acts that worked

## Even more important: All the things that aren't on your list, but could be.
