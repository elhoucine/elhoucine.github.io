I was always wondering about, what droves me -or someone else-, to minimalism, maximalism or any otheralism.

People often say each one has his own taste, own opinion, unique way of thinking... everyone is different. But are we really all different ?

It turns out that we are a complicated creators, especially when emotions are involved.

But there is one thing, the only one thing that we all have in commun, but sometimes we -implicitly- ignore, we are naturalist by default.

Our home is nature, and the more we get far from it, the more we suffer, that's exactly what is happening with cityalism, and buildinglism.

Everyone nowadays becomes facinated and obsessed by new technologies. Technology -as anything else- meant to help us live better by simplifying life. But if our life is already stollen from us, what can technology do ?

We are all naturalism, nature is where spirit finds its peace, nature is us. But we are insisting on killing it -by ignoring that fact-, and we are using execuses like technology, to lie about it.

DISCLIMAR:

`I am not against technology, in fact I do use it, & I like what it can provide to our compfort.``

But when the technology giants' purpose is just to make the most profitable outcome out of it -AKA changing tha world-, in a world full of distraction and disorders, then it become obvious -to me at least- that this technology can present more damage than good -at least if we don't use it purposefuly-.

Just see how most people use Facebook, and the irony of students disabling their fb account to focus on exams. Or when parents buy technology to their kids in order to make them happy, then complain that their kids become addicted or start developing some sort of bad or unexpected behavior. Here come some questions.
*Does the power of technology exeeded our awareness of its damages ? Or does its power exeeded our capacity of control ?*

### The right type of technology.
The right type technology is the one that is not meant to dominate or control us. If you feel that you can't live -whatsoever- without a specific technology -except the one that can bring you to life after death, or makes you live longer-, then it is obvious that you are addicted, highly influenced, dominated or controlled by your desire to use it.

### The right dose of technology:
The power of technology is that it looks innocent, because on its own it reveals innocent goals, often --- as making the world a better place, and because it gives us the freedome to use without limitations.

But who is behind that technology? An investor with an only purpose: to make profit out of that innocent technology. And because using that tech just to the limit of our good isn't going to make any good profit, they start stadying our behaviors, and interactions, looking for patterns and ways to make us addicted. Just look at how fields like Data-statistics, Marketing, Growth Hacking... are in high demande by tech ontities.

Is that mean we shouldn't use technology ? Nope! It just mean that we should be aware!

### The art of mining the good out of technology:

### minimalist to naturalist
