People are different.

But there is one forgettably thing we all have in common, we are naturalist by default.

Nature is home, the farest we are, more we suffer. And that's exactly what is happening.

Technology meant to make us live better, not to make use suffer. But if our life is already stollen from us, less quality time with family, work-life unbalance, poverty, climate change, wars, unjustice, propaganda, lobbyists... Then how can technology help?

Nature is the quitest place, it is where spirit finds its peace, it is when you feel sometimes you have time and nothing to do, no notifications to worry about, and just meditate in your imagination, art or toughts.

Nature is when you have a clear disscution with a friend with no internet noise. Or having quality time with kids without potential distraction.

But we are insisting on killing that pure life -by ignoring that reality-, and we are using technology as execuse.

DISCLIMAR:

`I am not against technology, in fact I do use it, & I like what it can provide to our compfort.``

But when the technology giants' purpose is to make the most profit possible out of it -AKA changing tha world-, in a world full of distraction and disorders, then it become obvious -to me at least- that this technology can be more damage than good -at least if we don't use it purposefuly-.

If facebook is a great technology then why students need to disable their accounts to focus on exams. Why some parents complain about their kids addiction to video games, tv or some smart device
.
*Does the power of technology exeeded our awareness of its damages ? Or does its power exeeded our capacity of control ?*

### The right type of technology.
The right type technology is the one that defines its limit. If you feel that you can't live without a specific technology -except immortal tech-, then it is obvious that you are addicted, highly influenced, dominated or controlled by your desire to use it. I must add you are not free.

### The right dose of technology:
Technology looks innocent, often with the mask of making the world a better place, it allows us freedome of use, and no limitations.

But who is behind that technology? An investor with the money mentality: Make profit out of that innocent technology.

Using that tech only to the limit of our good isn't going to make any good profit. So stadying our behaviors, interactions, patterns, pshycology, and doing anything to make us addicted is the way to go, the way of evil.

Shouldn't we use technology at all? That's not the case! We just should be aware!


### The balance:
Technology is getting toward people virtualisation, everything now proves fictions scenareos can come true.
