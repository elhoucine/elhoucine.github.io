If you search on Google you will find similar posts with the same title as this post. Because writing a blogpost about it helps you speed up the process and get 'Priority Access' to the Toptal platform.

But, was that my motivation to write it ? Definitely Not!

In the completing your profile section, I got asked if I want a 'Priority Access' then I have to write a blog post on my website explaining
why I am committed in joining Toptal, I skipped it right away, because it simply didn't motivate me.

After skipping it, I asked my self, seriously, why I am admitted in joining the Toptal Web Developers Network anyway ?  And hell, yeah! the desire to answer this question, and write a blog post about it comes suddenly!

And here is the answer to that why, summed in 3 points.

1- **Freelancing**:
The obvious motivation is of course freelancing, after doing full-time job for a while, it didn't work well for me, so I decided to work remotely, because simply I found it hard to stick in one place.

2- **Quality**:
Okay, looking at all the open-source platforms, where everybody try to sell them selves, and the need to deal with automatic examination and test which by the way easy to crack, it didn't feel the best option for me, so I had to look for better. Toptal selection is human made, and the process is serious. And that explains well the 3% promise.

3- **Challenging**:
Looking at some discussions on the net, I found that some people are complaining about getting rejected from Toptal, that's it. It is not easy, it is not for everybody. That challenged me, and I am eager to take that challenge.
