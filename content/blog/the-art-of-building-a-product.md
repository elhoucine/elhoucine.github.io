## What is the best product?

The best product is the one people want.

The great marketing tells people why they need it.

Build something people want, and tell them about it. That's the art of building a product.

## Does your product sells your marketing, or your marketing sells you product?

```
A lot of founders really struggle trying to market and sell something that people don’t want or don’t need. If your product is crap, there is no marketing strategy — and no source of investment — that can keep it alive for long.
```

Quoted from this impressive story [How my friends and I grew our side project into a $17,000/month](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/growing-a-side-project-into-a-17-000-month-business-46024d2aa87f#.qz22hz7p2).


## How Apple uses marketing?

_This is iPhone 7, it makes all the things you do with your iPhone better, faster, and more powerful._ These were the first words in [this iPhone 7 ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6dsRpVyyWs) from apple. They tell you exactly why you need to buy this new iPhone. That's the marketing, and if it's NOT packed with something you want, then it's just crap.


## Conclusion:

Building something people want seems easy. In theory, it is, but it is not in practice. Building something people want often means listening to them, caring about them, getting their feedback seriously. And top of all knowing your users and sticking with them, one can not satisfy the whole population.
