* What is a great idea?
* Is there such a thing as a great idea?
* How do we know that an idea is great?
* Where to look for it?
* How to test it?

I never had the chance -yet- to found a great idea, a great idea I believe is the idea that no one or only a few people thought of and believe in, And the one that can bring value to people, the one that people need it.


Ideas are worthless, because if they are worth something an ideas market should be around, so they have no demand, and that's a perspective that can be true. But maybe a market for ideas could be a great idea? And maybe there is no demand because no one thought that it can be a demand, and that's how great ideas look like.

I think The hardest thing about great ideas is how to know them. A sure path is to look for existing successful ones and see how they were perceived at the beginning. Most of them are normal now, but at the beginning, they were almost weird, crazy, or seem impossible. So maybe absurdity is a sign.


Great ideas are great because they are not normal or easy to get, they need more effort, a different process of thinking and maybe, also different perspectives.

I started recently seeing things from as different-weird-crazy perspectives as possible, for example I am fan of healthy fast food business, so I started to see the problem differently, like what if I can customize my healthy sandwich from an app, some robot do the work, and receive it by drone, and all the process can be done with less than 30 minutes? a controlled healthy process, fast, cheap. That what if is a weird door opener.


Not all great ideas will work, of course, great ideas remain simple ideas until executed, and I think that execution will show you how great your idea is. If it is great enough you may be lucky to succeed even if you start with a shitty product. And sometimes you may start with fancy stuff but not succeed.

I believe that other factors play as well, like timing, environment, and people, if you are lucky enough to get some or all of them right, then bingo.

And I still believe that luck plays as well!
