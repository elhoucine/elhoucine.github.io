* Writing this, why?
* A great idea, what is it?
* Ideas are worth something?
* This idea is great, how do we know?
* Where to look for it?
* How to test it?

II never had the chance -yet- to find a great idea, I decided maybe writing about it could be a good start.

before, it looked unpromising, but after execution people loves it, it becomes an everyday life thing! That was my definition of the great idea.

Ideas are worthless if they are worth something a big market would be around. That’s a maybe-true-perspective. But what if it’s not? Then a market for ideas turns out to be great, there is a high hidden demand, which explains why great ideas are hard to see.

>“If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.” ― Albert Einstein

See how existing successful ideas were perceived at the beginning, they were almost weird, crazy, or impossible.

>Great ideas are great because they are outside the fashion, they demand more effort, different thinking and sometimes dreaming.

I started seeing things from as different-weird-crazy perspectives as possible. I am fan of healthy fast food business, so I decided to see the problem differently: what if I can open the app customize my healthy sandwich (The work done by trained robots) and receive it by drone, it should be faster and cheaper.

>Changing perspectives could be a good exercise for to look for new, fresh, and potential great ideas.

Of course, not all great ideas will work, and they will remain simple ideas until executed, in fact, only the execution shows how great your idea is. If it is great enough you may be lucky to succeed even if you start with a poor looking but a functional product. Sometimes even if you start fancy, success may not be your friend.

Timing, environment, and people are part of the execution and success equation. If you got some or them all, then bingo.
