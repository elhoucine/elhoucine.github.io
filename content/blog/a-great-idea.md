+++

I never had the chance -yet- to find a great idea, I decided maybe writing about it could be a good start.

Before, it looked unpromising, but after execution people loves it, it becomes an everyday life thing! That was my definition of the great idea.

>“If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.” ― Albert Einstein

See how existing successful ideas were perceived at the beginning, they were almost weird, crazy, or impossible.

Great ideas are outside the fashion, they are uncomfortable to work with, they demand more effort, vision, different thinking and sometimes dreaming.

Seeing things from different perspectives helps. I am fan of healthy fast food business, my imagination is always on: what if I can open an app customize my healthy sandwich (The work done by trained robots) and receive it by drone, it should be healthier, faster and cheaper.

>Changing perspectives could be a good exercise for to look for new, fresh, and potential great ideas.

Of course, not all great ideas will work, and they will remain simple ideas until executed, in fact, only the execution shows how great your idea is. If it is great enough you may be lucky succeeding with a poor looking but a functional product. Sometimes even if you start fancy, success may not be your friend.

Timing, environment, and people are part of the execution and success equation. If you got some or them all, then bingo.
