“If most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes and shoddy furniture, let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies.”
Albert Einstein

We become obsessed with appearances, that we may judge people by what they wear, worst, treat them depending on it, even worst, doing it with our selves as well.

And yet we don't question the quality of the ideas we are feeding to our selves, as that this matter doesn't matter.

As shabby clothes, shabby ideas exist too, `I can't do it`, `I should wear a suit to look serious`, `It is too late to do it`, `I am a failure`, `racism`, `Préjugés`... Why aren't we ashamed of these as well?

I think this comes from 3 things:

- `Obey society’s expectations`
- `Conformity`
- `Lack of mono confidence`.

With `mono confidence` I mean to be confident in doing what others don't expect you to do, to upset them with your doings, meaning instead of being embarrassed by doing what they are not expecting you to do, you upset them by doing it, while being totally comfortable. In other words, to believe in and follow your dreams.

Many of the successful people through history were `minimalists` they preferred living a simple life, they refused to be trapped by
society's expectations, they saw the word differently, they do the things that no one does, and that was the key to their greatness.
Einstein was one of them, and yet after sixty years of his death, his name is continuingly appearing everywhere, thanks to his quotes, books, ideas, philosophies... Not to his clothes.

I am ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies.

`Look at the inside`.
