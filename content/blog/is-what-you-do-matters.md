We often get busy doing what we do in our lives without taking the time to think clearly about the meaning and the impact of what we are doing. I think one should at least figure out what really matters to him and figure out how to live according to that. I know that life is hard but living a unfinished race against time is even harder.


## Does it have meaning **for me** ?

This is a good question to answer, because what we do determines who we are, and who we will be.

`` Is what I am doing worth telling to my children ? ``

A normal, and a calculated-for-safety life is boring to tell, only the **risky**, **challenging**, unusual life is worth telling, and interesting, and capturing.

A **risky**, **challenging**, and unusual life is like a movie, where you are the protagonist, you have a goal in mind, there is plenty of obstacles, you may suffer, you may give up for some time, but you fight again until you achieve what's yours.


## Caring about the world.

Caring about the world is something meaningful, because **we are not living alone**, and our lives depends on each other, and you are not only a citizen of your country, you are a citizen of the world.

The world needs us more than ever, it needs us to follow our dreams, to live purely, to be human, to connect and to care.

## Doing ART!

```
I want them to discover that they are artists;
everyone is an artist, a creator, and refiner of sensibility without knowing it.
--Yves Klein
```

Art is a form of freedom, because to do art is to listen to our inner voice, and imagination, it is about doing one's original version. So rather that following instructions we create them. Doing an original/quality work, or making someone's day is also an form of ART.

## Connecting with others.

```
We are like islands in the sea, separate on the surface but connected in the deep.
― William James
```

I think this may be the most meaningful thing on earth, connecting with other people, discovering new cultures... Travel is a way of doing that, and that's what I like most about traveling.

## Connecting with self.

```
The most beautiful things can only be created by the most free minds!
― Mehmet Murat ildan
```
Imagine a world where the sky is upon our heads, where space is filled with few vital but many trivial things, we will barely breath, and we will barely live.

Freeing our mind, eliminating the external noise, and making space for what matters, is the core to keep our mind in good state and our life under control.
