We often get busy doing what we do in our lives without thinking much about the meaning and importance or the impact of what we are doing, we keep running in all directions, work, family, friends, future, things to buy, dreams... until we get exhausted, some of us keep the fight, while some take a time to connect and relax, but in all cases we all admit how hard and busy this life become.

## Is what I am doing matters ?

This is a good question to answer, because after all what we do determines who we are and who we will be.

`` Is what I am doing worth telling to my children ? ``

A normal, safe life is boring to tell, only the weird, **risky**, out of the box, **hard**, unusual, **challenging**, adventurous life is worth telling, and interesting, and capturing.

## Caring about the world.

Caring about the world is something meaningful, because **we are not living alone**, and our lives depends on each other, and you are not only a citizen of your country, you are a citizen of the world in the first place.
If we cannot contribute to a better world, at least we can care about that, poverty, wars, children, climate change... We can start caring about one of these (If we are not already), getting more information and spreading the message.

## Doing ART!

```
I want them to discover that they are artists;
everyone is an artist, a creator, and refiner of sensibility without knowing it.
--Yves Klein
```

Art is a form of freedom, because to do art is to listen to our inner voice, and imagination, it is about doing one's original version. So rather that following instructions we create them. Do more art.

## Connecting with others.

```
We are like islands in the sea, separate on the surface but connected in the deep.
― William James
```

I found that this is one of the most meaningful things on earth, connecting with other people, discovering new cultures. Travel is a way of doing that, and that's why you will find travelers a happier and open minded people.

## Connecting with self.

```
The most beautiful things can only be created by the most free minds!
― Mehmet Murat ildan
```

Freeing our mind, eliminate the garbage forced by our modern society, and making space for what matters, is the core to keep our life under control.
